# From Source to Sound
## The Impact of Speaker Enclosures and Environment on Audio Transmission.
### Overview:
This repository contains the final project developed for the Acoustic Engineering course (UPF, 2024–2025), taught by Prof. Bart Bijnens.
The project investigates how speaker enclosure design, room acoustics, and recording equipment quality influence sound transmission, frequency response, and perceived audio fidelity.

The work combines theoretical acoustics, experimental measurements, and signal processing analysis to study how different physical and environmental factors shape the final recorded sound.

The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze how different speaker enclosures affect sound radiation and frequency response.
- To evaluate the influence of room acoustics on recorded audio signals.
- To compare low-fidelity vs high-fidelity recording devices.
- To compute and analyze transfer functions of speakers and rooms.
- To synthesize audio that reproduces the acoustic characteristics of different setups.

Project done by Aina Gutiérrez, Rita Cots, Xavier Riera and Pau Noguera.
